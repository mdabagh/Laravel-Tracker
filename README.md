# Laravel Tracker

Laravel Tracker is a package for automatically tracking user activity and route usage in Laravel applications. It automatically identifies all web and API routes and logs the user's IP address, username (if logged in), response time, response content, and how long the user spent on each page. This information is then recorded in a database table for analysis.
